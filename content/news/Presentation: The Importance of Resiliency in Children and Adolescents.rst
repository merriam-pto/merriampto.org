Please join us Wednesday, May 27 at 7:00 pm in the Parker Damon Cafeteria to learn about the importance of resiliency in children and adolescents. The focus will be on the myriad of strategies needed to overcome challenges and pitfalls presented in their lives.

We are excited to bring in educational consultant *Gail Okerman* to talk to elementary school parents about this important topic.

Please contact `Hilary Bonnell<mailto:hilarybonnell10@gmail.com>`_ with any questions.
